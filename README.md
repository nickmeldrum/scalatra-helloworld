# Hello world project in scalatra

Just here so I can get a simple understanding of how scalatra works and what is a good way of setting up a project with respect to testing and building it.

Based off my other scala hello world project (for understanding scala and sbt): [https://github.com/nickmeldrum/scala-sbt-helloworld](https://github.com/nickmeldrum/scala-sbt-helloworld)
